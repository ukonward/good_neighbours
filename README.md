How are our estimates of social trust by neighbourhood constructed?

Methodology

FocalData surveyed 42,696 adults across England. Respondents were asked how much they trust other people, using a standard question from the British Social Attitudes survey: “Generally speaking, would you say that people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” Respondents were asked to say whether they think that people can almost always or usually be trusted or that you usually or almost always can't be too careful in dealing with people.

FocalData then ran a multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) to estimate average levels of trust in each neighbourhood, which we defined as a Middle-Layer Super Output Area (MSOA). The model included individual and area characteristics, including: overcrowded housing, ethnicity, health, qualification levels, housing tenure, social grade, age and gender.
